This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This serves as a showcase of my coding and design capabilities.

The original Figma file for the design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/AQtHb9dPx1zBTHUAL9bVhH/Buffer-application-website?type=design&node-id=15%3A142&mode=design&t=5oe2ogsCTf5Flki3-1).

The final, hosted version of this site can be viewed [here](https://hiring-umar-buffer.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Note that we are using Next.js's experimental SSL feature.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load custom Google Fonts.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/).
